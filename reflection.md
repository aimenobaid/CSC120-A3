- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Java feels very unintutive right now in terms of syntax when compared to Python, which is expected whenever you learn a new language. I have not revisited Java since freshman year of highschool so it all feels very new. The code provided was super useful for getting used it.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
The Java syntax is a lot more complex and less psuedocode-like vs Python has always felt like if psuedocode was a language. 
I realized how to order of methods matters less than it would if this was written in Python becasue it's compiled altogether, this is slightly confusing for me because if I was writing it scratch I would have a hard time organizing/understanding what the best practice is.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found that I had a hard time getting started: figuring out what functions to use/what the correct syntax for each function looks like. I spent most my time doing this assignment going through documentation trying to get comfortable with it. 
I would highly reccommend the rubber duck method, my background in programming is primarily numerical simulations, data analysis and visualization for very abstract ideas in physics so getting used to object-oriented ideas is definitely outside comfort zone. Sitting with a peer or a TA just to talk through the logic was super helpful especially if you're having trouble reorganizing your logic to be object-oriented.
